    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> See how i didn't say roasted chicken? Because it's NOT.</p>
    <p>The name m’hammar comes from ah’mar, which is the color red in Arabic. (Do not confuse this word with h’maar, which means donkey.) In traditional m’hammar recipes, we are looking for a mahogany-red color to meat or poultry.It’s a slow-cooking method with two different cooking stages—stovetop in a pot followed by roasting or frying—and it always has a savory flavor profile.</p>

    <h3>Ingrediant</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> Chicken</li>
        <li> ALL THE SPICES </li>
        <li> Lemon is a must </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li> brining is the first step</li>
        <li>Next comes the marinating stage, when we should allow at least a few hours for the meat or chicken to infuse with spices. </li>
        <li>The first stage of cooking follows, preferably a day ahead of serving, to allow the meat another chance to absorb the spices.</li>
        <li>The last cooking step of roasting or frying is done just before serving at a late lunch or late dinner..</li>
        
    </ol>
