# Recipes-website
This is the website: https://guiguisalma.github.io/Recipes-website/
I decided by fun to learn developing so i'll keep track of my learning-by-doing in github.
This repository contains my firt project, a Moroccan Recipe website!ðŸ˜Š

I don't think it's neeful to explain the code as it's simple but i like to keep track of ***best practices*** to do.

### Best Practices:
- Always have an ``index.html`` in main so you could devploy your website via github actions and others could view your website.
- Why we add `rel="noopener noreferrer` when adding links, specially **absolute links**, it's for **Security Reasons**.
Like preventing **Phising attacks**, the attacker won't know the source webpage from where the opened link was from.
> (ã‚œÏ‰ã‚œ)=ðŸ‘‰ absolute links are the one that provides the full information for their localization: protocol, domain,directory... it's the full URL.
